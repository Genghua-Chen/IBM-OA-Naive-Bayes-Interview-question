# IBM OA Naive Bayes Interview Question

## Problem
Given a labeled dataset of messages, train a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn and predict which of them are spam.

Build a Naive Bayes model that can identify spam messages.

This is an NLP problem, in this case, I am using TF-IDF text transformation and transform text into vector after clean all the punctuation.

## Evaluation Metric:
This metric used for evaluating the performance of the model is F1 score.
